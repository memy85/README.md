## Who am I?
Hello! I am a master's student in the department of Biomedical Systems Informatics in College of Medicine, Yonsei University. Prior to studying biomedical informatics, I was working as a nurse. I became interested in biomedical informatics because of Watson and Alphago. I thought it would be nice to build an AI that could help people in the world suffering from illness. My goal is to build a very smart AI machine that can help people prevent disease and help clinicians make smart, fast and accurate decisions. If you have any questions using my code for commercial purpose or research projects or just to have fun, whatever it is, do not hesitate to contact me! You can get in touch with me via E-mail! Thank you!
