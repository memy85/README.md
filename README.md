## Who am I?
Hello! I am a master's student in the department of Biomedical Systems Informatics in College of Medicine, Yonsei University. Prior to studying bimedical informatics, I was working as a nurse. I became interested in biomedical informatics because of Watson and Alphago. I thought it would be nice to build an AI that could help people in the world who suffer from illness. My goal is to build a very smart AI machine that can help people prevent disease and help clinicians make smart, fast and accurate decisions. If you have any questions using my code for commercial purpose or research projects or just to have fun, whatever it is do not hesitate to contact me via E-mail! Thank you!
